<p>‚ÄúArchitecture is the scientific art of making structure express ideas.‚Äù ‚Äî FLW (1932)</p>

<p>These rules can fit in the context of most organic elements, including the conceptual #prairie.</p>

<p>Horizontal over vertical, so that the prairie house can find its place in the prairie‚Äôs flatness and endless horizon.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><em>Form Follows Predominant Feature</em></p>

    <p>A prairie house is the fundamental narrative, the culmination of all of its organic elements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Prospect and Refuge</em></p>

    <p>Prospect is a sense of connection with the wide, flat, surrounding open landscape, that is balanced with a sense of privacy, shelter, and refuge from the harsh reality.</p>

    <p>Instead of adding entirely new floors, elevate certain living spaces to be higher than the terrain. Surround the house with fences, but not high enough to block the view of the prairie.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>A Chimney As Anchor</em></p>

    <p>Fireplace should be solid and big, placed in the center. It should serve as the pivot point of the house. It‚Äôs size &amp; strength reflect immortality, and its warm heat brings members of all ends of the house to a unified center.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Cantilevered Terrace</em></p>

    <p>Integrate with the natural context by creating a terrace to bridge inside with outside freely. Thrust the terrace structure out from the prairie house‚Äôs main structure making use of cantilevered beams supported solely by existing elements of the house.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Bands of Windows</em></p>

    <p>Windows speak to the intent behind the design and the needs of the house. They create the setting in which the rooms permeate in, mood and tone. Create windows with low walls, and with little space between each other.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Fireplace as Refuge</em></p>

    <p>Focus on the sense of withdrawal of the fireplace by making the ceiling low, achieving a sense of symmetry and convergence with both interior elements and form.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Prospective Views</em></p>

    <p>Offer different views of the horizon with variation in what is seen and how its seen. Take into account balancing the ‚Äúopen‚Äù and ‚Äúclosed‚Äù by different internal needs and seasonal changes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Concealed Verticals</em></p>

    <p>Deliberately hide the vertical door behind a screen, and construct a path from screen to door. Minimize the amount of verticality, maximize horizontal similarity.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Circuitous Approach</em></p>

    <p>A well-marked pathway to enter into the screen is needed. Use pillars to signify the beginning of the path, possibly a garden to guide the transition, as well as a ending that hides the prairie. In other words, allow someone to envelop themselves in a world that appears parallel to the landscape, but offers a natural transition into a completely unparalleled experience.</p>

</ol>

<p>Create a Room (Atomic level)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Roof must stay intact <em>(‚Äúleaf node‚Äù)</em></li>
  <li>Door must be carved <em>(‚Äúlinks‚Äù)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Create a Hallway (Molecules)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hallway for parallel doors (<em>‚Äúmolecules‚Äù)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The prairie style method is combined with [[51-Zettelkasten-principles]] to translate ideas to rooms, as well as the cultivation of new ones to eventually tell a story that is the prairie home.</p>
