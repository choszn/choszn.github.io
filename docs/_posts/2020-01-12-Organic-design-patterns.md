Organic design patterns.

If you design something based off of an organism or organic function, it will generally behave the same way and/or create an ecosystem of living things that are in harmony. 

Why? Feel your heartbeat. It has been beating throughout every second of your life, and it is the single universal indicator of life and the end.



*When in doubt, always start from the heart. When you are able to keep the heart in rhythm, then you can control the arms and legs of an organization. Depending on your purpose, you might be running fast sacrificing harmony and inclusivity. You might slow down to avoid the risk of total heart failure.*

If you want to find value, go to the endpoints of the emotions that surround our heart, which happens to be when they beat the fastest, or the most consistently. If you want to find one endpoint, for example, you can pull at a human'sÂ sexual and violent desires. If you want to maintain value, you would try to find discipline and cut out noise.
