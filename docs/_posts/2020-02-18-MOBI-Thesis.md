Mobius DApp Store is a open-source, non-custodial "wallet" interface for easily sending crypto payments to apps. MOBI is the main tool in that process.

There is also a Mobius standalone wallet that uses MOBI to carry out transactions.

Mobius went dark in 2018, completely. You can't even access the apps on the app store.

David Gobaud reappeared with Passfolio, a stock broker that allows individuals to invest in the US market, ETFs, REITs, and Cryptocurrencies. One thing to note is that passfolio wins in fees and ease of access.
