# Why Stellar?

Stellar is a open-source network for currencies and payments, using its own Stellar Blockchain which beats Bitcoin and Ethereum in speed, cost, and efficiency. Their main focus is inclusivity--making sure that anyone can access financial services.

**Values:** |User-Obsession | Accountability | Respectful Candor | Tenacity | Camaraderie

Total: 50 billion XLM, 20 billion in open market and 30 billion owned by SDF



The fee for a given transaction is equal to the number of operations the transaction contains multiplied by the base fee for a given ledger.



1. Open-source and inclusive. Stellar Development Foundation has done case studies to empower developing countries and those who can't reach financial institutions. For example, Saldo allows migrant workers to support family members back home by making it easy to pay bills across borders. This makes Stellar the prime candidate for universal adoption, as confirmed with their ongoing partnership with IBM. A cryptocurrency's value rises with (1) adoption and (2) demand. Stellar will rise in demand as its underlying blockchain becomes needed to carry out large scale global transactions, while tapping into the unbanked to increase adoption.
