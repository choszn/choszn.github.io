On the prairie we follow some [rules](51-Elements-of-a-prairie-style-home.md).

- **Room** is an atomic, autonomous note in Markdown.
  - Every room has a door, a descriptive link.
- **Hall** contain *doors* to related *rooms* to depict a common theme.
- **Terrace** is a .md note that draws connections from the rooms to the context of the prairie.
- **Chimney** is a .md note that is the unifying narrative of everything above.



While living on the prairie, thereâ€™s a lot to learn, starting from the [[[50-Glossary]]].



Tags:

- *tutorials* | for practical steps + studying (get started)
- *how-to* | for practical steps + application (how-to guides)
- *reference* | for theoretical concepts + application (technical reference)
- *eli5* | for theoretical concepts + studying (context)

## Doors

We can use [[[50-templates]]] to build rooms, halls, and more.

We build considering the [[[51-Zettelkasten-principles]]], atomically and dynamic.

Most importantly, we want to tell meaningful stories that encompass the [[[51-Elements-of-a-prairie-style-home]]]
