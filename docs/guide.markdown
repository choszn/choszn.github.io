This is where we build ideas and compose narratives in a similar fashion to a [prairie home](/design/2020/12/25/Elements-Of-A-Prairie-Home).
 

- A **Room** is an atomic, autonomous note in Markdown.
  - Every room has a door, a descriptive link.
- A **Hall** contain *doors* to related *rooms* to depict a common theme.
- A **Terrace** is a .md note that draws connections from the rooms to the context of the prairie.
- A **Chimney** is a .md note that is the unifying narrative of everything above.

From a worm's eye view of the prairie, we can see nearby, related [flowers](/Tags).<br />
From a bird's eye view of the prairie, we can see clear, distinct [fields](/categories). <br />
