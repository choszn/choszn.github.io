This is where we build ideas and compose narratives in a similar fashion to a [prairie style home]({% post_url 2020-12-25-Elements-Of-A-Prairie-Home %}).
 

- <span style='font-size:25px;'>💧</span> A **Room** is an atomic, autonomous note in Markdown.
  - <span style='font-size:25px;'>🚪</span> Every room has a door, a descriptive link.
- <span style='font-size:25px;'>🌊</span> A **Hall** contain *doors* to related *rooms* to depict a common theme.
- <span style='font-size:25px;'>&#9748;</span> A **Terrace** is a .md note that draws connections from the rooms to the context of the prairie.
- <span style='font-size:25px;'>☃️</span> A **Chimney** is a .md note that is the unifying narrative of everything above.
